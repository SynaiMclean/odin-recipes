    <h2>Description:</h2>

    <p>Spinach dip is a creamy, savory appetizer made with cooked spinach blended into a rich base of cream cheese, sour cream, and mayonnaise. It’s often seasoned with garlic, onion, herbs, and Parmesan or mozzarella cheese, giving it a flavorful and slightly tangy taste. Some versions include chopped water chestnuts for added crunch or artichokes for extra depth. </p>

    <p>This dip is typically served warm and melty from the oven or chilled as a refreshing cold dip. It pairs perfectly with tortilla chips, bread, crackers, or fresh vegetables, making it a popular choice at parties, game nights, and gatherings.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <h3>Main Ingredients:</h3>
        <li>1 package (10 oz) frozen chopped spinach, thawed and well-drained</li>
        <li>1 cup sour cream</li>
        <li>½ cup mayonnaise</li>
        <li>1 block (8 oz) cream cheese, softened</li>
        <li>1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>½ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>

        <h3>Flavor Boosters:</h3>
        <li>1–2 garlic cloves, minced</li>
        <li>¼ cup finely chopped onion or green onions</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Start by preparing the spinach. If you're using frozen chopped spinach, thaw it completely and squeeze out as much excess water as possible using a clean kitchen towel or paper towels. This prevents the dip from becoming watery.</li>
        <br>
        <li>In a mixing bowl, combine the softened cream cheese, sour cream, and mayonnaise. Mix until the mixture is smooth and creamy. You can use a hand mixer or stir vigorously with a spoon.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Add the drained spinach to the bowl along with shredded mozzarella, grated Parmesan, minced garlic, and chopped onion or green onions. Season with salt and pepper to taste. If you’re using extras like chopped artichoke hearts or water chestnuts, stir them in at this stage.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Mix everything together until well combined and evenly distributed.</li>
        <br>
        <li>If you're making a hot dip, transfer the mixture to a baking dish and bake at 375°F (190°C) for 20–25 minutes, or until hot and bubbly with a lightly golden top. For a cold version, simply chill the mixture in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour before serving.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Serve your spinach dip warm with tortilla chips, sliced baguette, crackers, or raw veggies. If chilled, give it a stir before serving to keep it smooth and creamy.</li>
    </ol>
