    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>Pizza is a popular Italian dish made with a round, flattened base of dough topped with a variety of ingredients and baked until the crust is golden and the cheese is melted. The most classic version, Margherita, features tomato sauce, mozzarella cheese, and fresh basil—representing the colors of the Italian flag. However, pizza can be endlessly customized with toppings like pepperoni, mushrooms, onions, olives, sausage, peppers, pineapple, and more. </p>

    <p>With its crispy crust, gooey cheese, savory sauce, and flavorful toppings, pizza is beloved worldwide and served in countless styles—from thin crust and Neapolitan to deep-dish and stuffed crust.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>

    <ul>
        <h3>For the Pizza Dough:</h3>
        <li>2 ¼ tsp (1 packet) active dry yeast</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups warm water (110°F / 45°C)</li>
        <li>3 ½ to 4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>1 tsp sugar</li>
        <li>1 tsp salt</li>

        <h3>For the Pizza Sauce:</h3>
        <li>1 cup canned crushed tomatoes (or tomato sauce)</li>
        <li>1–2 garlic cloves, minced</li>
        <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>1 tsp dried oregano or Italian seasoning</li>
        <li>alt and pepper to taste</li>

        <h3>For the Toppings (basic Margherita):</h3>
        <li> ½ cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>Fresh basil leaves (optional but traditional)</li>
        <li>Olive oil (for drizzling)</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li> Start by making the dough. In a bowl, combine warm water, sugar, and yeast. Let it sit for 5–10 minutes until it becomes foamy. Then add flour, salt, and olive oil. Mix everything together and knead the dough until it becomes smooth and elastic, about 8–10 minutes. Cover the bowl and let the dough rise in a warm spot for about 1 hour, or until it has doubled in size.</li>
        <br>
        <li>While the dough is rising, make the sauce. In a small saucepan, heat some olive oil and sauté the minced garlic for about 30 seconds. Add the crushed tomatoes, oregano, salt, and pepper, and let the sauce simmer gently for 10–15 minutes. Set aside to cool.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 475°F (245°C). If you're using a pizza stone, place it in the oven so it can heat up along with it.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Once the dough has risen, punch it down and roll it out on a floured surface into your desired shape—usually about 12 inches in diameter. Transfer it to a baking sheet or pizza peel lined with parchment paper.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Spread a thin layer of your sauce over the shaped dough. Sprinkle shredded mozzarella cheese evenly across the top, and add any other toppings you like, such as pepperoni, mushrooms, bell peppers, or olives. Optionally, drizzle a little olive oil over everything for extra flavor.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Place the pizza in the oven and bake for 12–15 minutes, or until the crust is golden and the cheese is melted and bubbly. Let the pizza cool for a few minutes before slicing and serving.</li>
    </ol>
